# WTFDWGBO
A small script that repetitively pings a server in order to find out when it goes back online.

# How to use it
Just execute the script with two parameters: the website you want to ping and the delay time in seconds between a ping and the other.
# Configuration
Open the script and set up an email address and an email server so that when the server online the program can alert you properly.
